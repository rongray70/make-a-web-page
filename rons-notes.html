		<p>HTML is <b><em>reasonably</em> straightforward</b></p>
		<p>Line breaks (br)<br>are called inline tags while paragraph (p) tags are block tags.  Block tags can optionally have a defined height/width.</p>
		<p>This is how a <a href="google.com">link</a> works.</p>

	<div class="notes">
		<p>Have realized that I am not a note-taker for some of this stuff... not much to put into 'code' for Work Session 1.</p>
		<p>'div' is used for blocks and the class can be used with css for styling.</p>
		<p>'span' is used inline and can also have classes that can be defined in css.</p>
		<p>Don't really see all of the point of 'span' yet... am guessing it will be more obvious once we get into css.</p>
		<p>I really wish the class had a better table of contents or more obvious way of seeing where you are at versus where you were last at.  Tried going back a few videos to review and then had to keep skipping through videos I had already seen before finally figuring out where I had been.</p>

		Adding CSS Style to HTML Structure

		<p>Order matters when defining css.</p>
		<p>You could also use 'style' within the 'head' section of an html page to define styles, but using a separate css file allows you to apply/modify your style across multiple pages without having to update each html page.</p>
		<p>You could even add style settings in the 'div'.</p>
		<p>An exhaustive css reference is available at <a href="https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/CSS/Reference">mozilla</a>.</p>
		<p>Boxes have:  margin / border / padding / content</p>
		<p>HTML and CSS can be validated:

				<li>To verify HTML: <a href="http://validator.w3.org/#validate_by_input">http://validator.w3.org/#validate_by_input</a></li>
				<li>To verify CSS: <a href="http://jigsaw.w3.org/css-validator/#validate_by_input">http://jigsaw.w3.org/css-validator/#validate_by_input</a></li>
